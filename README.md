# PROHOW Algorithms

The `prohow_functions` and `sparql_queries` contain the Python implementation of the PROHOW competency questions, which require the [rdflib](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib) library.

A suit of tests is included, and ir can be run by running the `run_tests` script.

## Test processes

These processes are used in the tests:
